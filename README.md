# Interior 
Interior is a form of travel app that allows users to track and share their trips to America's National Parks. 
The [back-end](https://github.com/cswilik/interior-backend) was built with Ruby on Rails and was seeded with the NPS API. The front-end was built with React/Redux and custom CSS.


### Key User Stories 
Users can login/signup with their email. After logging in, you can view your dashboard, your public profile and all the trips you've taken. Users can also view and search all 63 National Parks. Each park has an individual page with travel info and a space to see other user's trips and subsequently their profiles. Users can add/edit/delete trip info.
